#### M2M
Starting a blog series, Month to Master (M2M).
This is  inspired by blog series of [Max Deutsch](https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch), in which he picks up challenging tasks, to complete it in 30 days. The best being the chess match with Magnus.

In this series, I will be picking up (_somewhat!_) tough challenges, which I would aim to complete in a month.
In the interim, I am to blog about the preparation and process, that is going into solving the challenge.

#### Why am I doing this?
To challenge myself, to new boudaries of knowledge and perseverance.
On the way, also satisfy my hunger and curiousity to learn new things.

#### The First Challenge : Remember all Capital Cities of World
This is something, I wanted to master since long. As of today (May 2019), there are about 196 countries.

The challenge is to remember all the countries and their capital. Not Simple, many of the them are tongue twisters.

##### How do I plan to Achieve this?
Well, in muy school days, I used the memory techniques i read in book Page a Minute Memory Book by Harry Loryane, to memorize the capital cities of India. I plan to use the same. It's been long since, I used the memory techniques. Thus, first few days, will need to brush them up. Meanwhile, there could be some newwer techniques as well, that I can explore. The list of capital cities, that I would be referring to is listed [here](https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/capitals-of-the-world.html). This seems to be authentic, with recent updates, being reflected as well.

##### Where do I stand today, in remembering the capitals?
An important steps, is to identify and measure your current position. For this, i scooped thru the internet, and got a timed quiz link [here](https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/name-world-capitals). This ensures coverage of all conuntries, and the timed quiz adds another dimension to the challenge !! :-)
I generally, keep myself abrest with the latest in current affairs. But, to my astonishment, i got a dismal score of 26/196, in my first formal attempt.
So thats a huge leap to go in next 30 days.

**Let's see how this goes, in my next blog**
