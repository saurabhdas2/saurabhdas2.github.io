### Lookback at 2020 Learnings and Thoughts
Here is some of the learnings from year 2020, for life. Also, some mantra and thoughts and defined the year,
1. Expect the un-expected
2. Focus on aspects that you can control and influence. Leave the rest to almighty.
3. Time can't be managed. We need to manage ourselves and our priorities.
4. Devote un-divided attention to present, and tasks in front of you, to achieve success.
5. Health is important, which includes mind, body and soul. Spend time to care for each.
6. Nothing in life should be taken for granted. Cherish, nurture and nourish each and everything.

Year 2020, started with swift moves, towards my international travel and relocation, towards Apr 2020. Covid-19 pandemic changed all that. The scale and impact of year 2020, can seldom be felt today. Ongoing pandemic has profound impact to all aspects of life and living. Life may not be same again. As all nations strive to contain and control the virus, the challenges have kept increasing. History will decide and judge the actions and decisions taken were right or wrong. Nothing in life should be taken for granted.

In next blog, I will try to share my thoughts and goals for year 2021.
